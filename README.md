## The Story
I made this game in a little over an hour!
I was struggling with the Star Wars RPG so much I pulled this out as a back-up and it turned out really well. The star wars game eventually got put together but I actually was more proud of this. Crystal Counter is fun to play, has sounds and looks great.

## Game Play
Each crystal button has a secret numerical value, when you click a crystal that value is added to your total. Try to get your total to match the Goal Number. Each round of the game the value of the crystals is reset.
